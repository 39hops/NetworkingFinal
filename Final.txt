q1 - q10
subnet an ip
class c
give all details

255.255.255.0/24

- how many useable ips for that subnet mask
- first last usable hosts
- subnet mask
- what is / notation
- broadcast for that network
- how many bits did you borrow
- how many bits left over for host
- how many useable hosts in the subnet (usable ip address)
- max number of subnets

11-13:
socket programming

14:
layer 2 broadcast
ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

know about ipv6:
- unicast
- multicast
- anycast

ipv4:
- unicast
- multicast
- broadcast

IPV6:
DF26: 16 bits each

16:
- IPv6:
- Pay attention to the hex numbers in the IPv6 number
- will ask you which is a valid ipv6

17: Shorten an ipv6
:: and 00 (leading zeros)

18:
- Know about the linked local in IPv6:
- fe80::/64

19:
Another socket programming:
- Knowing about Socket, SocketServer

20:
Expand a shortened ipv6 address

21:
- How many layers in OSI model: 7

22:
- Know about about the OSI model

23:
- Know about mac addresses
- How do switches learn the mac address

24:
three way handshake

25:
know about the arp command
arp -a
arp -d*

26:
What is the most reliable protocol for connection:
HTTP
DNS
TCP
UDP

27:
Know what TTL does.
Max hops in WINDOWS: 128

28:
scenerio:
whats the subnet mask of that scenerio?

29:

- know about the arp again
- what does it do?

30:
- memorize the port numbers bro
- FTP, TCP, DNS maybe on it

31:
OSI Model:
- what layer deals with pictures and videos

32:
what layer deals with CRC

33:
know about the classes of ip addresses in binary
1 - 126
128 - 191
192 - 223

34:
what class of ip, gives you equal networks and hosts

35:
how does the switch forward the frame to the destination

36:
picture question:
same thing for the sba, when pc1 talks to pc2 what is the destination address between a hop

37:
when the switch is empty and two pcs want to talk together: if there is no entry, then it will broadcast to everyone but the pc sending the message

38: know about udp:
does not guarantee connection
best effort
connction-less

39:
gonna get a class C ip ip address, find how many usable hosts with the \cidr

39:
MDIX: auto cable, what does it do

40:
TCP/IP protocols:
- ICMP

41:
know the well known ports
0-1023 or 1024
EUI-64

42:
socket programming again

43:
DHCP: know the sequence
1. Computer looks for a DHCP Server: Discovery
2. DHCP Offers you an IP: Offer
3. Take the IP: Take

44:
Which device takes a default gateway

45:
OSI model, Application Protocols: know about them all

46:
Access methods
Collision Avoidance and Collision Detection

47:
Know about congestion bits per second

48:
which organization gives you ip addresses IANA

49:
Definition of Ethernet

50:
Know about the port numbers again

51:
Cross-talk
twisting wires to avoid cross talk

52:
what is the job of a router
allows you to leave the network

54:
what is the job of a switch?
full duplex
smart device
doesn't cause traffic

55:
when you are pinging ICMP

56:
when you send a signal from pcA to pcB find the mac address at this hop

57:
what is a topology:
the physical layout of the network

58:
picture about wireshark
"it's so obvious, you won't believe it"

59:
DLSN Subnetting
