### **Subnetting and IP Details (Q1 - Q10)**
1. **Subnet Mask and CIDR Notation (`/24`)**
   - **Subnet Mask:** 255.255.255.0
   - **CIDR Notation (/24):** Indicates 24 bits are used for the network.

2. **Key Points:**
   - **Usable IPs:** 2⁸ - 2 = 254 (subtract network and broadcast addresses).
   - **First Usable Host:** Add 1 to the network IP (e.g., `192.168.0.1` for `192.168.0.0/24`).
   - **Last Usable Host:** Subtract 1 from the broadcast IP (e.g., `192.168.0.254` for `192.168.0.255`).
   - **Broadcast Address:** The last address in the range (e.g., `192.168.0.255`).
   - **Bits Borrowed/Left:** From /24, borrowing none leaves 8 bits for hosts.
   - **Max Subnets:** Depends on borrowed bits (e.g., borrowing 2 bits gives 4 subnets).

### **Socket Programming (Q11, Q19, Q42)**
- Understand `Socket` and `SocketServer` concepts in Python/Java/C.
- Basics: Establishing connections, listening, and sending data.

---

### **IPv6 and IPv4 (Q14 - Q20, Q33, Q34, Q36, Q39)**
1. **IPv6:**
   - **Address Structure:** 128 bits, split into 16-bit hexadecimal blocks.
   - **Types:**
     - **Unicast:** Single interface.
     - **Multicast:** Multiple interfaces.
     - **Anycast:** Closest interface.
   - **Local Link:** `fe80::/64` used for devices in the same link.
   - **Compression/Expansion:** `::` for zeros, remove leading zeros.
   - **Validation:** Check proper format for valid/invalid addresses.

2. **IPv4:**
   - **Unicast, Multicast, Broadcast:** Understand differences.
   - **Classes:**
     - A (1-126), B (128-191), C (192-223).
   - **CIDR and Usable Hosts:** E.g., `/24` → 256 - 2 = 254 hosts.

---

### **OSI Model (Q21, Q22, Q31, Q32, Q45)**
1. **7 Layers:**
   - Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical.
2. **Layer-Specific Tasks:**
   - **Pictures/Videos:** Presentation Layer.
   - **CRC (Error Checking):** Data Link Layer.
   - **MAC Address Learning:** Data Link Layer.

---

### **Three-Way Handshake and ARP (Q24, Q25, Q29)**
1. **TCP Three-Way Handshake:**
   - SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK.
2. **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):**
   - Resolves IP to MAC.
   - Commands: `arp -a` (view cache), `arp -d` (clear entries).

---

### **Protocols, Ports, and Devices (Q26, Q30, Q50)**
1. **Reliable Protocol:** TCP (connection-oriented).
2. **Common Ports:**
   - FTP (21), DNS (53), HTTP (80), HTTPS (443).
3. **DHCP Process:**
   - Discovery → Offer → Request → Acknowledge.

---

### **Wireshark and Networking Concepts (Q58, Q57, Q48)**
1. **Wireshark Tips:**
   - Look for obvious patterns like protocol headers.
2. **Topology:**
   - Physical (e.g., star, bus, mesh).
3. **IANA:** Assigns IPs globally.

---

### **Other Key Terms (Cross-Talk, Ethernet, Switches, MDIX)**
- **Cross-Talk:** Twisting wires reduces interference.
- **Ethernet:** Defines network communication standards.
- **Switches:** Operate in full-duplex, direct traffic.
- **MDIX:** Auto-corrects cable type mismatches.

### Study Recommendations:
1. Practice subnetting calculations thoroughly.
2. Review key differences between IPv4 and IPv6.
3. Memorize well-known port numbers and OSI layer functions.
4. Go through examples of TCP/IP communication (e.g., DHCP, ARP).
5. Familiarize yourself with common tools like Wireshark.
